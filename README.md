A production-ready demonstration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for cybersecurity attack path analysis with intelligent remediation workflows. This project represents a sophisticated integration of multiple Advanced AI technologies - from Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models (LLMs) to Multi-Agent Systems, RAG, and MCP - all working together to solve one of the most challenging problems in cybersecurity: understanding and defending against complex attack paths in real-time. It's not just AI, it's Advanced AI that can reason about complex relationships, make autonomous decisions, and continuously learn and adapt.

## üîó Connected Project

This GNN Attack Path Demo is designed to integrate seamlessly with the [Threat Intelligence Graph project](https://github.com/dgatlin/threat_intel_graph) - a production-ready threat intelligence platform that transforms raw threat data into actionable intelligence through real-time graph analytics, multi-source threat ingestion, and advanced correlation algorithms. Together, these projects form a complete cybersecurity AI ecosystem that combines internal attack path analysis with external threat intelligence for comprehensive security insights.

## üåü Highlights
- **Top-K risky paths & assets** with node/edge risk scores and concise, graph-grounded rationales  
- **Agentic remediation bundles** that minimize blast radius, with predicted Œîrisk and IaC diffs (dry-run)  
- **Simulation mode** to validate fixes before any real changes  
- **Built-in MLOps**: Optuna HPO + MLflow tracking/registry  
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured logs

## üß† Why Graph Neural Networks for Attack Paths?
- **Topology-aware**: naturally models ingress, IAM, vulns, and lateral reach  
- **Propagation modeling**: learns how attacks traverse relationships, not just isolated findings  
- **Contextual risk**: considers local + global graph context for better prioritization  
- **Scales**: bounded subgraph scoring and caching handle **10K+ nodes** with <2s p95 latency

## üåü Key Features

### üß† **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) - The Core AI Innovation**

![Graph Neural Networks](docs/images/gnn_example.jpg)

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** are a powerful class of deep learning models designed to work with graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that process fixed-size inputs, GNNs can handle variable-sized graphs with complex relationships between nodes and edges.

In our attack path analysis, GNNs excel at:
- **Learning Graph Representations**: Each node (asset) and edge (connection) gets meaningful embeddings
- **Attention Mechanisms**: The model learns which connections are most important for attack paths (Œ±·µ¢‚±º coefficients)
- **Message Passing**: Information flows through the network to identify attack patterns
- **Scalable Analysis**: Handles networks with thousands of nodes and edges efficiently

The mathematical foundation: `h'·µ¢ = œÉ(Œ£‚±º‚ààN·µ¢ Œ±·µ¢‚±ºWh‚±º)` where nodes aggregate information from their neighbors using learned attention weights.

**Why GNNs for Cybersecurity?**
- **Network Topology Understanding**: GNNs naturally model network connections and dependencies
- **Threat Propagation**: Learn how attacks spread through interconnected systems
- **Contextual Risk Assessment**: Consider both local and global network context
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improve as new attack patterns emerge

- **Graph Neural Networks**: PyTorch Geometric models (GraphSAGE & GAT) for sophisticated attack path scoring
- **Advanced RAG**: Graph-aware retrieval with contextual explanations and recommendations
- **Natural Language Processing**: Conversational interface for complex security queries
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Seamless tool integration for AI agent communication

### ü§ñ **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Orchestration**

![Agentic AI Architecture](docs/images/agent.png)

### üîó **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**

**Seamless AI-to-System Communication** through standardized protocol that enables AI agents to interact with external systems, databases, and tools in a consistent, language-agnostic way.

**MCP Architecture:**
- **üõ†Ô∏è MCP Server**: Exposes graph operations as standardized tools
- **üîå MCP Client**: Provides seamless communication interface

- **`analyze_asset_risk`**: Analyze risk for specific assets
- **`propose_remediation`**: Suggest security fixes and remediation
- **`get_graph_statistics`**: Get overall graph metrics and insights

**Key Benefits:**
- **üîß Seamless Integration**: AI agents can easily access graph data without knowing database specifics

- **‚ö° High Performance**: Async communication with sub-2s response times

**Real-World Impact:**
Instead of hard-coding database connections, AI agents can now use natural language queries like *"Find attack paths from external servers to our database"* and the MCP protocol automatically translates this into the appropriate graph operations, making the system more maintainable and extensible.

### **üß† How It Works**

The GNN learns attack patterns from historical cybersecurity data, enabling it to identify high-risk attack paths and predict potential vulnerabilities. The agentic system then autonomously analyzes these patterns, proposes intelligent remediation strategies, and simulates their effectiveness‚Äîall through natural language interaction. This creates an end-to-end AI workflow that transforms raw security data into actionable insights and automated responses.
