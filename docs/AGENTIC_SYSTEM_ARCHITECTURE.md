# Agentic System Architecture

## Overview

The GNN Attack Path system implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that orchestrates intelligent cybersecurity analysis and remediation. The system uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration, MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration, and Graph Neural Networks for attack path scoring.

## How the Agentic Components Work

### Core Agent Architecture

The system is built around four specialized agents that work together through a state-based workflow:

**1. AttackPathAgent (Main Orchestrator)**
- **Purpose**: Central coordinator that manages the entire workflow using LangGraph
- **How it works**: Maintains a state object that flows through workflow nodes, making conditional routing decisions based on user intent
- **Key capability**: Decides whether to proceed with analysis-only, remediation, or simulation based on user queries

**2. AttackPathPlanner (Planning Agent)**
- **Purpose**: Analyzes user queries and generates intelligent analysis plans
- **How it works**: Uses pattern matching to identify user intent (find riskiest paths, attack paths, remediation, simulation) and selects appropriate algorithms
- **Key capability**: Transforms natural language queries into structured analysis plans with specific targets and algorithms

**3. RemediationAgent (Action Agent)**
- **Purpose**: Generates and simulates security remediation actions
- **How it works**: Analyzes attack paths to identify vulnerabilities, generates specific remediation actions, and simulates their impact
- **Key capability**: Creates Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) changes and estimates risk reduction

**4. MCPEnhancedAgent (Tool Integration Agent)**
- **Purpose**: Integrates external tools through the Model Context Protocol
- **How it works**: Wraps MCP tools as LangChain tools and handles async operations
- **Key capability**: Provides seamless access to external cybersecurity tools and databases

### LLM Integration and Usage

The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) in several key ways:

**1. AttackPathPlanner LLM Usage**:
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo (configurable)
- **Purpose**: Natural language query understanding and plan generation
- **How it works**: The planner uses LLMs to parse user queries, extract intent, and generate structured analysis plans
- **Example**: Converts "What are the riskiest paths to our database?" into a structured plan with target="database", algorithm="hybrid", intent="find_riskiest_paths"

**2. MCPEnhancedAgent LLM Usage**:
- **Model**: GPT-4 (configurable)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent tool orchestration and response generation
- **How it works**: Uses LLMs to coordinate multiple MCP tools, interpret results, and generate human-readable responses
- **Example**: Combines results from multiple security tools to provide comprehensive threat analysis

**3. LangChain Integration**:
- **Framework**: LangChain for LLM orchestration
- **Tools**: LangChain tools wrap MCP capabilities for seamless LLM interaction
- **Prompting**: Structured prompts guide LLMs to understand cybersecurity context and generate appropriate responses

**4. Fallback and Error Handling**:
- **Mock Mode**: When LLM APIs are unavailable, the system falls back to rule-based pattern matching
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function with reduced intelligence when LLM services are down
- **Testing**: All LLM functionality is mocked in tests to ensure reliable testing without external dependencies

### Workflow Execution

The system follows a state-based workflow pattern:

```
User Query → Planner → Retriever → Scorer → Explainer → 
    ↓ (conditional routing)
    Remediator → Simulator → Verifier → Response
```

**State Management**: A centralized state object flows through all workflow nodes, maintaining context and collecting results. Each agent can read from and modify the shared state.

**Conditional Routing**: The system intelligently routes workflows based on user intent:
- Analysis queries: Stop after explanation
- Remediation queries: Continue to remediation and simulation
- Simulation queries: Skip to simulation phase

## Testing Strategy and Validation

### Comprehensive Test Coverage (17/17 Tests Passing)

**Unit Testing Approach**:
- **Mock-based testing**: All external dependencies (OpenAI API, Neo4j, MCP servers) are mocked to ensure tests run without external services
- **LLM mocking**: OpenAI API calls are completely mocked to test agent logic without requiring API keys or external services
- **Component isolation**: Each agent is tested independently with controlled inputs and expected outputs
- **Error condition testing**: Tests validate graceful degradation when components fail

**Integration Testing**:
- **API endpoint validation**: All REST endpoints are tested for correct responses and error handling
- **End-to-end workflow testing**: Complete user journeys from query to response are validated
- **Concurrent request handling**: System stability under load is verified

**Test Results Breakdown**:

**Agent Component Tests (7/7 PASSED)**:
- Intent recognition and parsing
- Target extraction and algorithm selection  
- Path analysis and remediation action generation
- Action prioritization using impact/effort ratios
- Risk explanation generation
- Simulation of remediation effects

**API Integration Tests (10/10 PASSED)**:
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Attack path analysis endpoints
- Crown jewels and algorithms endpoints
- Risk explanation endpoints
- Complete workflow validation
- Error handling and concurrent requests

### How Testing Validates Agentic Behavior

**1. Intent Recognition Testing**:
```python
def test_planner_intent_recognition(self):
    assert planner._parse_intent("What are the riskiest attack paths?") == "find_riskiest_paths"
    assert planner._parse_intent("How can I fix these security issues?") == "remediate_risks"
```

**2. Workflow Routing Testing**:
```python
def test_should_remediate_decision(self):
    assert agent._should_remediate({"user_query": "Fix these issues"}) == "remediate"
    assert agent._should_remediate({"user_query": "Show me paths"}) == "end"
```

**3. Action Prioritization Testing**:
```python
def test_remediator_action_prioritization(self):
    # Tests that actions are prioritized by impact/effort ratio
    prioritized = remediator._prioritize_actions(actions, constraints)
    assert prioritized[0]["id"] == "1"  # Highest impact/effort ratio
```

**4. End-to-End Workflow Testing**:
```python
def test_complete_workflow(self):
    # Tests complete user journey: crown jewels → attack paths → risk explanation → metrics
    response = self.client.get("/api/v1/crown-jewels")
    # ... validates entire workflow
```

## System Capabilities Demonstrated

**Intelligent Decision Making**: The system successfully parses natural language queries and routes them through appropriate analysis paths.

**Adaptive Remediation**: When remediation is requested, the system analyzes attack paths, generates specific security actions, and simulates their impact.

**Tool Integration**: External tools are seamlessly integrated through MCP, allowing the system to access external cybersecurity databases and services.

**Error Resilience**: The system gracefully handles failures by falling back to mock data and continuing operation.

**State Management**: Context is preserved throughout the workflow, enabling complex multi-step analysis and remediation processes.
